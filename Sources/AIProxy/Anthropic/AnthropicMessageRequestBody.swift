    /// The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.
    ///
    /// Note that our models may stop before reaching this maximum.
    /// This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

    public let maxTokens: Int

    /// Input messages.
    ///
    /// Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns.
    /// When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter,
    /// and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation.
    ///
    /// Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
    ///
    /// Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`.
    /// You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
    ///
    /// If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message.
    /// This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.
    ///
    /// Example with a single user message:
    ///
    ///     [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
    ///
    /// Example with multiple conversational turns:
    ///
    ///     [
    ///       {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
    ///       {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
    ///       {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
    ///     ]
    ///
    /// Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
    ///
    ///     [
    ///       {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
    ///       {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
    ///     ]
    ///
    /// Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`.
    /// Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`.
    /// The following input messages are equivalent:
    ///
    ///         {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ///
